The goal of ussie is to demonstrate the usage of devtools/testthat for package development using the engsoccerdata() dataset. The function created will create a column that will help join two datasets that may be different based on the country they are from.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ussie from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:


``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("miosisoniii/ussie")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: Each dataset from each country has a different structure, so comparison by join is possible by adding a column *country*.

```{r example}
library(ussie)
## basic example code
uss_make_matches(engsoccerdata::italy, "Italy")
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:
```{r}

```
